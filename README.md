# Lunch Break Weather App - Week 3: Fetch API

This project is a mini weather application built as part of a 4-week coding challenge I'm undertaking during my lunch breaks. I'm using an iPad and GitHub Codespaces for this challenge, which makes it a fun and portable way to learn and build.

## Project Goal

The goal of this week's challenge is to utilize a public API to fetch and display data. In this case, I've chosen to build a simple weather app that retrieves and displays the current weather for a specified city.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
* **JavaScript:** For fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the HTML.
* **OpenWeatherMap API:** A public API to retrieve weather data.

## Features

* Displays the current weather for a specified city (Jacksonville in this case).
* Shows the city name, weather description, weather icon, and temperature in Fahrenheit.
* Handles API fetch errors and displays appropriate error messages.

## How to Use

1.  **Sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key:**
    * Go to [https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and create an account.
    * Obtain your API key.
2.  **Replace the placeholder API key:**
    * In the `script.js` file, replace `//your api key here.` with your actual API key.
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in a web browser:**
    * If using codespaces, utilize the simple browser option, or open in a new tab.

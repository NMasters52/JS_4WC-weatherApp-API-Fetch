# Lunch Break Weather App - Week 3: Fetch API Challenge

## Project Overview
This mini weather application demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript to fetch and display real-time weather data. Built during lunch breaks using GitHub Codespaces on an iPad, this project showcases how to work with external APIs, handle promises, and implement proper error handling.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Page structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design (customize as needed)
- **JavaScript**: Core application logic with async/await implementation
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Data source for current weather conditions

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays current conditions for Jacksonville, FL
- **Async JavaScript**: Implements modern async/await pattern for API requests
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for network issues and API failures
- **Weather Visualization**: Shows city name, weather description, temperature, and corresponding weather icon

## Code Highlights
- Asynchronous data fetching with proper error handling
- Clean separation of concerns (data fetching, display, error handling)
- Modern JavaScript techniques for working with APIs
- Defensive programming with response validation

## How to Use
1. **Get an API Key**:
   - Create a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
   - Navigate to the API Keys section to generate your key
   - Note: New API keys may take a few hours to activate

2. **Add Your API Key**:
   - Open `script.js`
   - Replace the existing API key with yours in the `apiKey` variable

3. **Launch the App**:
   - Open `index.html` in any browser
   - If using GitHub Codespaces, use the "Open in Browser" option

## Future Enhancements
- Add city search functionality
- Include extended forecast data
- Implement geolocation for local weather
- Add weather unit conversion (°F/°C)
- Improve UI with additional weather metrics (humidity, wind, etc.)

## Learning Journey
This project represents Week 3 of a 4-week lunch break coding challenge. The constraints of building on an iPad during lunch breaks made this an interesting challenge in efficiency and focused coding.
